# Predictions of urban forests diversity and structure for the Minneapolis - St. Paul metropolitan region

**About the map**

We used machine learning ensemble models to integrate data from forest inventories (40 12.5-meter radius plots; Marcilio-Silva et al. 2022 <https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/166a4b954ecaaabcda75bd51004804a5>), GEDI observations, and Sentinel-2 derived land surface phenology (described in Marcilio-Silva et al. in review). These models enabled accurate predictions of the nine forest attributes presented here: plant diversity (tree species richness, tree abundance, and understory plant abundance), structure (average canopy height, diameter at breast height (DBH), and canopy density), and structural complexity (variability in canopy height, DBH, and canopy density) with relative errors ranging between 11% to 21%. Each point in this map shows the predicted forest attributes based on our models. The layer named “Footprints” shows the in-groud size of the GEDI footprints and surveyed plots (12.5-radius circle), thus it is only visible at higher zoom views.

All the displayed predictions will automatically show their legend on the right side of the map. The “Footprints” layer shows the in-groud size of the GEDI footprints (12.5-radius circles).
 
As an example, by selecting to show the Number of Tree Species on the Layer tool, the following legend will automatically be shown on the map:
